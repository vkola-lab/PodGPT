He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, and aspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease. Subsequent peripheral angiography shows severe stenoses of the right superficial femoral and the left common iliac arteries. The patient undergoes uncomplicated placement of two sequential vascular stents in the superficial femoral artery and placement of an additional stent in the left common iliac artery. The type of stents used was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been heavily marketed as a long-lasting solution to restenosis. Each stent costs the hospital $15,000.
