He lives in a nursing care facility and has been bedridden for the past 3 years. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications are metformin, amlodipine, and aspirin. Noninvasive vascular studies of the lower extremities show marked bilateral vascular disease.

Temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), pulse is 160/min, and respirations are 36/min. Examination shows fluctuance and exquisite tenderness to palpation of the perianal mass. Oral acetaminophen and a dose of oral cephalexin are administered, and the parents are told that their child’s case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. They are referred to the nearest hospital with a pediatric service, a suburbanhospital 50 miles away. The suburban hospital is contacted regarding the referral and a pediatric surgeon accepts transfer of the patient. When the patient is brought to the ED of the suburban hospital, a triage nurse obtains his oral temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and pulse of 126/min. The nurse notes that the family has no health insurance and states that the case is beyond the capabilities of the hospital. The nurse recommends taking the patient to the ED of a downtown university hospital 4 miles away. The parents follow this recommendation, and the patient undergoes incision and drainage of the abscess at the downtown hospital later that day.
